cd into the root directory

the . is for src directory in this case already determined with copy command
docker-compose run composer create-project laravel/laravel .

docker-compose run artisan composer install

added to package.json in scripts "watch": "vite build --watch"
docker-compose run npm install

docker-compose run npm build

run watch if working on the project
docker-compose run npm watch

src directory is created when you run create command and laravel files will be in that folder
